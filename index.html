      <p class="text_muted">Quaint little reasturaunt tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will 
        miss the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says 
        "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The reasturaunt has a reasonably good menu at 
        reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be 
        shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a tendy crowd of aprising celebrities on show days. be sure
        to book in advance to avoid dissapointments, On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & 
        happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi Fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

      <p class="text_muted">Between 1724 and 1730 Maharajah Sawaii Jai Singh II of Jaipur constructed five astronomical observatories in northern India. The observatories, or "Jantar Mantars" as they are commonly known, incorporate multiple buildings of unique form, each with a specialized function for astronomical measurement. These structures with their striking combinations of geometric forms at large scale have captivated the attention of architects, artists, and art historians world wide, yet remain largely unknown to the general public. </p>

    <p>I watched it today with my kids and loved it. You should have a minimal previous understanding of the story, or you will miss 40% of the fun. You should watch Infinity War, Black Panther, Age of Ultron, and Ant Man and the Wasp before watching Avengers Endgame. The entire movie pays homage to the other Marvel superhero movies. You will enjoy it alot. There is, at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. The movie is based on the most talked action packed sci-fi serise. The movie shows how the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore balannce to the univerce. the movie is lengthy and it runs for 3 hours, but it is all worthwhile. </p>

    <p>This is a fantastic movie, and I am not lying! my 13 year old sister loves this movie, and I can't fault this either. It was one of the first movies I ever saw, so that accounts for how much I love it. The animation is superb, the backgrounds look so rich, and for once, there are no stiff movements. The highlights were the stampede and the fight between Scar and Simba. The music by Hans Zimmer is outstanding, a perfect mix of African chants and pure Hollywood. The songs are absolutely great, I had no idea that Elton John could write like that. The best song is "Can you feel the Love Tonight?" but the others go without fault, "Circle of Life" is so spirit rousing especially. Likewise with the voice overs. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is very likable as Young Simba, and Matthew Broderick, while not as good, is above average too. James Earl Jones lends his booming voice to the majestic King Mufassa, and Nathan Lane, Rowan Atkinson and Whoopi Goldberg provide flawless comic relief. The vocal standout is Jeremy Irons as Scar, who frightened me when I was little. Scar is up there with the best Disney villains, like Jafar, Malificent and Frollo. The humour here is fantastic, and you cry here a bit here as well. I highly recommend the stage version in the West End, and the sequels are actually two of the better DTV sequels.10/10.
